## Prompt 1
**Prompt:**
Take a look at the cell tagged "nltk". What is "punkt" and "averaged_perceptron_tagger" and why is it needed?

**Answer:**
Let's break down the cell tagged "nltk" from your notebook:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

### What is "punkt"?

- **"punkt"** is a pre-trained model for tokenizing text into sentences and words.
- It is used by NLTK's `sent_tokenize` and `word_tokenize` functions.
- **Purpose:** It helps split large blocks of text into sentences and words, which is a fundamental step in most natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

### What is "averaged_perceptron_tagger"?

- **"averaged_perceptron_tagger"** is a pre-trained part-of-speech (POS) tagger.
- It is used by NLTK's `pos_tag` function.
- **Purpose:** It assigns grammatical tags (like noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence, which is important for understanding the structure and meaning of text.

### Why are they needed in your notebook?

- **Text Processing:** Many NLP pipelines, including those for document analysis, question generation, and knowledge graph construction, require breaking text into sentences/words and understanding their grammatical roles.
- **Ragas & LangChain:** These libraries may use sentence splitting and POS tagging for tasks like summarization, question generation, or extracting entities/themes from documents.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** The notebook downloads these resources to ensure that tokenization and tagging work correctly on any OS, avoiding errors due to missing NLTK data.

**In summary:**  
- `"punkt"` is needed for sentence and word tokenization.  
- `"averaged_perceptron_tagger"` is needed for part-of-speech tagging.  
Both are foundational for robust text processing in your synthetic data and RAG pipeline.

## Prompt 2
**Prompt:**
Read what is on cell tagged "gen_synthetic_data". In this context, what does "directional" changes in LLM-based systems mean?

**Answer:**
In the cell tagged "gen_synthetic_data" (the markdown cell before generating synthetic test data), the following is stated:

> NOTE: Ragas is best suited for finding *directional* changes in your LLM-based systems. The absolute scores aren't comparable in a vacuum.

### What does "directional" changes mean in this context?

**"Directional" changes** refer to the ability to detect whether your system is getting better or worse as you make changes, rather than focusing on the exact value of the evaluation metric.

- **Directional change** = "Did my score go up or down after I made a change?"
- **Not absolute** = "Is my score 0.7 or 0.8, and is that good or bad in an absolute sense?"

#### Why is this important for LLM-based systems?

- **LLM evaluation metrics** (like those produced by Ragas) are often not calibrated to a universal scale. A score of 0.8 in one context may not mean the same as 0.8 in another.
- **Synthetic data** is generated to simulate real-world queries, but may not perfectly represent actual user data or ground truth.
- **Comparing absolute scores** across different datasets, models, or even runs can be misleading.
- **Tracking directional changes** (improvement or degradation) is reliable for iterative development: if your score increases after a change, your system likely improved for your use case.

#### Example

- You run your pipeline and get a score of 0.65.
- You make a change (e.g., better chunking, new retriever) and the score goes to 0.72.
- The **directional change** (increase) tells you your change was beneficial, even if you don't know if 0.72 is "good" in an absolute sense.

---

**Summary:**  
*"Directional" changes* mean using the evaluation to see if your system is improving or getting worse as you iterate, rather than focusing on the absolute value of the score. This is especially useful in LLM-based systems where absolute metrics are often context-dependent and not directly comparable across different setups.

## Prompt 3
**Prompt:**
Take a look at the cell tagged "kb_build_nodes". There are only 4 PDF documents in the "data" folder, why are there more than 20 possible nodes to be created?

**Answer:**
Great question! Here’s what’s happening in the cell tagged `"kb_build_nodes"`:

```python
for doc in docs[:20]:
    kg.nodes.append(
        Node(
            type=NodeType.DOCUMENT,
            properties={"page_content": doc.page_content, "document_metadata": doc.metadata}
        )
    )
kg
```

You noticed that there are only **4 PDF documents** in the `data/` folder, but the code is able to create up to 20 nodes (and the notebook shows even more nodes in the knowledge graph after transformations).

### Why are there more than 4 nodes?

**Short answer:**  
Each PDF is split into multiple smaller documents (chunks or pages) before being loaded into the knowledge graph, so each chunk/page becomes a separate node.

---

### Detailed Explanation

- **PDF Splitting:**  
  When you use `DirectoryLoader` with `PyMuPDFLoader`, each PDF is not loaded as a single document. Instead, it is split into multiple smaller documents—typically one per page, or sometimes even smaller chunks depending on the loader’s configuration.

- **`docs` Variable:**  
  After running:
  ```python
  loader = DirectoryLoader(path, glob="*.pdf", loader_cls=PyMuPDFLoader)
  docs = loader.load()
  ```
  The `docs` list contains **one entry per page (or chunk)** of each PDF, not one per file. So, if your PDFs are long, you could easily have 20+ entries in `docs` even with just 4 files.

- **Node Creation:**  
  The loop:
  ```python
  for doc in docs[:20]:
      kg.nodes.append(...)
  ```
  is iterating over the first 20 chunks/pages, not the first 20 files.

- **Result:**  
  The knowledge graph ends up with a node for each chunk/page, not just one per PDF.

---

### How to check this yourself

You can check how many chunks/pages were created by running:
```python
print(len(docs))
```
This will likely be much greater than 4, matching the number of nodes you see.

---

**Summary:**  
> There are more than 4 nodes because each PDF is split into multiple smaller documents (pages or chunks), and each of these is loaded as a separate node in the knowledge graph. This chunking is standard practice for document processing in RAG pipelines, as it improves retrieval and downstream performance.

--- 

## Prompt 4
**Prompt:**
take a look at cell tagged "default_transforms" and the next code cell, we are essentially creating meta data to extract meaning from the document and then using it to use cosine similarity to create relationships between the nodes (ie. docs) in the knowledge graph correct?

**Answer:**
Yes, your understanding is correct!

Let’s break down what’s happening in the cell tagged `"default_transforms"` and the next code cell:

---

### What happens in `"default_transforms"` and the following cell?

#### 1. **Applying Default Transforms**
```python
from ragas.testset.transforms import default_transforms, apply_transforms

transformer_llm = generator_llm
embedding_model = generator_embeddings

default_transforms = default_transforms(documents=docs, llm=transformer_llm, embedding_model=embedding_model)
apply_transforms(kg, default_transforms)
kg
```

- **Purpose:**  
  This code applies a series of transformations to the nodes (chunks/pages) in your knowledge graph (`kg`).

- **What are these transforms?**  
  The default transforms include:
  - **HeadlinesExtractor:** Extracts headlines from each document chunk.
  - **HeadlineSplitter:** Further splits based on headlines.
  - **SummaryExtractor:** Generates summaries for each chunk.
  - **ThemesExtractor:** Extracts broad themes.
  - **NERExtractor:** Extracts named entities.
  - **EmbeddingExtractor:** Generates vector embeddings for summaries and other properties.

#### 2. **Creating Metadata**
- These transforms add **metadata** to each node, such as:
  - Summaries
  - Headlines
  - Themes
  - Embeddings (vector representations)
  - Named entities

#### 3. **Building Relationships with Cosine Similarity**
- After metadata and embeddings are created, the code applies:
  - **CosineSimilarityBuilder**
  - **OverlapScoreBuilder**

- **What do these do?**
  - They use the vector embeddings (e.g., of summaries or themes) to compute **cosine similarity** between nodes.
  - If two nodes are similar enough (based on a threshold), a **relationship (edge)** is created between them in the knowledge graph.

---

### **Summary**

- **Yes, you are correct:**  
  The process first enriches each document chunk (node) with metadata that captures its meaning (summaries, themes, embeddings, etc.).
- Then, it uses the embeddings to calculate cosine similarity between nodes, and creates relationships (edges) between nodes that are semantically similar.
- This results in a knowledge graph where nodes (document chunks) are connected based on their content similarity and extracted meaning.

---

**In short:**  
You’re extracting meaning from the documents, representing that meaning as metadata and embeddings, and then using cosine similarity to connect related nodes in the knowledge graph. This is a core part of how RAGAS builds a semantically rich knowledge graph for synthetic data generation and evaluation.

--- 

## Prompt 5
**Prompt:**
What is OverlapScore?

**Answer:**
**OverlapScore** is a metric used in knowledge graph and information retrieval contexts to measure the degree of content overlap between two nodes (such as document chunks, summaries, or extracted entities).

### In the context of RAGAS and the notebook:

- **OverlapScoreBuilder** is one of the default transforms applied to the knowledge graph.
- It is used to create relationships (edges) between nodes based on how much their content overlaps.

---

### What does OverlapScore actually measure?

- **OverlapScore** quantifies the similarity between two pieces of text by looking at the intersection of their content.
- This is typically done by comparing sets of words, n-grams, or entities extracted from each node.
- The score is higher when two nodes share more content (e.g., more common words, phrases, or entities).

#### Example Calculation (simplified):

Suppose you have two document chunks:
- Chunk A: "The Department of Education provides federal loans."
- Chunk B: "Federal loans are provided by the Department of Education."

The overlap could be calculated as:
- Convert both to sets of words:  
  A = {the, department, of, education, provides, federal, loans}  
  B = {federal, loans, are, provided, by, the, department, of, education}
- Overlap = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|  
- The more words or entities they share, the higher the score.

---

### Why is OverlapScore useful?

- **Relationship Building:** It helps identify nodes that are closely related in content, even if their semantic meaning is not captured by embeddings alone.
- **Redundancy Detection:** It can help find duplicate or near-duplicate information.
- **Graph Enrichment:** By connecting nodes with high overlap, the knowledge graph becomes richer and more navigable for downstream tasks like question generation or retrieval.

---

### In summary

**OverlapScore** is a content-based similarity metric that measures how much two nodes (document chunks, summaries, etc.) overlap in their textual content. In your notebook, it is used to help build relationships in the knowledge graph, complementing embedding-based similarity (like cosine similarity) with a more literal, content-based approach.

--- 

## Prompt 6
**Prompt:**
Take a look at the cell tagged "ragas_query_synth". Please clarify my understanding: so what it does is using the information provided by the input data, ragas will come up with personas to perform a SingleHopSpecificQuery, MultiHopAbstractQuery and MultiHopSpecificQuery. Single Hop means we are doing Single Shot prompts and Multi Hop means Multi Shot prompts. Specific means there is clear information in the data to answer the query and Abstract means you would need some clarification in order to get to the final answer?

**Answer:**
Your understanding is mostly correct, but let’s clarify the terminology and process as used in the cell tagged `"ragas_query_synth"`:

---

### **What happens in the "ragas_query_synth" cell?**

- **Ragas** is used to generate synthetic queries (questions) based on your knowledge graph or document chunks.
- It uses the content and metadata of your data to create realistic, challenging queries for evaluation or testing.

---

### **Query Types Explained**

#### **1. SingleHopSpecificQuery**
- **Single Hop:** The answer can be found in a single chunk or node of your data (no need to combine information from multiple places).
- **Specific:** The question is direct and the answer is explicitly present in the data.
- **Example:**  
  *Q: What is the minimum number of weeks in an academic year for a credit-hour program?*  
  *A: 30 weeks.*

#### **2. MultiHopSpecificQuery**
- **Multi Hop:** The answer requires combining information from two or more chunks/nodes (i.e., you need to "hop" between pieces of information).
- **Specific:** The answer is still explicit in the data, but not in a single place.
- **Example:**  
  *Q: What is the minimum number of weeks in an academic year for both credit-hour and clock-hour programs?*  
  *A: 30 weeks for credit-hour, 26 weeks for clock-hour.*

#### **3. MultiHopAbstractQuery**
- **Multi Hop:** Again, requires combining information from multiple places.
- **Abstract:** The question is less direct, may require some reasoning, synthesis, or clarification, and the answer may not be a direct quote from the data.
- **Example:**  
  *Q: Why might a school request a reduction in the minimum weeks of instructional time?*  
  *A: For good cause, such as program structure or scheduling needs, subject to Department approval.*

---

### **Personas**
- Ragas can generate queries from different "personas" (e.g., a student, administrator, regulator) to simulate realistic information needs.

---

### **Clarifications on Your Understanding**

- **Single Hop ≠ Single Shot Prompt:**  
  - "Single Hop" refers to the number of data pieces needed to answer, not the number of prompt completions.
  - "Single Shot" and "Multi Shot" usually refer to prompt engineering (few-shot learning), which is different.
- **Specific vs. Abstract:**  
  - "Specific" means the answer is directly and clearly in the data.
  - "Abstract" means the answer requires inference, synthesis, or is not directly stated.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Query Type                | Data Needed      | Question Style | Answer Location         |
|-------------------------- |-----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| SingleHopSpecificQuery    | 1 chunk/node    | Direct        | Explicit in data       |
| MultiHopSpecificQuery     | >1 chunk/node   | Direct        | Explicit, but scattered|
| MultiHopAbstractQuery     | >1 chunk/node   | Indirect      | Requires synthesis     |

---

**In short:**  
- Ragas generates queries of varying complexity and directness, simulating real-world questions.
- "Hop" refers to how many pieces of data must be combined.
- "Specific" vs. "Abstract" refers to how direct the question/answer is.

## Prompt 7
**Prompt:**
Take a look at the cell tagged "rag_lcel" in the notebook. What is the pattern used to define the LCEL ? It doesn't look like a simpla LangChain

**Answer:**
Let's clarify the pattern used to define the LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) in the cell tagged `"rag_lcel"` and how it differs from a simple LangChain chain:

---

## **Pattern in the "rag_lcel" Cell**

The code in the `"rag_lcel"` cell is:

```python
from operator import itemgetter
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableParallel
from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser

rag_chain = (
    {"context": itemgetter("question") | retriever, "question": itemgetter("question")}
    | rag_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()
)
```

---

### **What is this pattern?**

- **LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** is a new, more composable and declarative way to build chains in LangChain.
- It allows you to define a pipeline using Python operators (`|` for chaining, `{}` for parallel mapping), making the flow of data explicit and modular.

#### **Key Features in This Pattern:**
1. **Dictionary Mapping:**  
   - `{"context": itemgetter("question") | retriever, "question": itemgetter("question")}`  
   This means:  
     - For the input, take the `"question"` field.
     - Pass it to the retriever to get `"context"`.
     - Also pass the original `"question"` through.

2. **Piping (`|`):**  
   - The output of the dictionary mapping is piped into the prompt template (`rag_prompt`), then into the LLM (`llm`), then into the output parser (`StrOutputParser()`).

3. **Composable, Modular:**  
   - Each step is a "runnable" that can be composed, reused, or swapped out.

---

### **How is this different from a simple LangChain chain?**

- **Classic LangChain:**  
  - You typically define a `Chain` object (like `LLMChain`, `RetrievalQA`, etc.) with fixed input/output keys and less flexibility in data flow.
  - The flow is more rigid and less transparent.

- **LCEL Pattern:**  
  - You can mix and match runnables, map over dictionaries, and use Pythonic operators for chaining.
  - The data flow is explicit: you see exactly how inputs are transformed and passed along.
  - Supports more complex, branching, or parallel flows.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Classic LangChain Chain         | LCEL Pattern (in notebook)                |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Uses `Chain` classes            | Uses composable "runnables"               |
| Fixed input/output keys         | Flexible mapping and transformation       |
| Less explicit data flow         | Data flow is explicit and modular         |
| Less composable                 | Highly composable and reusable            |
| Example: `LLMChain`, `QAChain`  | Example: `{"context": ...} | prompt | llm`|

---

### **Why use LCEL?**

- **Clarity:** You see the whole pipeline at a glance.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to swap, branch, or parallelize steps.
- **Reusability:** Each component is a standalone runnable.

---

**In summary:**  
The `"rag_lcel"` cell uses the new LCEL pattern, which is more declarative, modular, and composable than classic LangChain chains. It makes the data flow explicit and allows for more complex and maintainable pipelines.

## Prompt 8
**Prompt:**
In the cell tagged "langsmith_config" on the notebook, can you explain what the default langsmit "qa" evaluator is/does?

**Answer:**
Certainly! Here’s an explanation of what the default LangSmith `"qa"` evaluator is and does, as seen in the cell tagged `"langsmith_config"` in your notebook:

---

## **What is the LangSmith "qa" Evaluator?**

- The `"qa"` evaluator in LangSmith is a **Quality Assurance (QA) evaluator** designed to automatically assess the correctness of answers produced by your LLM or RAG pipeline.
- It is part of LangSmith’s suite of built-in evaluators for automated, LLM-powered evaluation of question-answering tasks.

---

### **How is it used in your notebook?**

```python
from langsmith.evaluation import LangChainStringEvaluator, evaluate

qa_evaluator = LangChainStringEvaluator("qa", config={"llm": eval_llm})
```

- Here, you instantiate the `"qa"` evaluator, specifying which LLM to use for the evaluation (e.g., GPT-4.1).

---

### **What does the "qa" evaluator do?**

- **Compares the model’s answer to a reference answer** (the “ground truth”).
- Uses an LLM to judge whether the model’s answer is correct, given the reference answer and the original question.
- The LLM is prompted to act as a grader, providing a score or label (e.g., “correct”, “incorrect”, or a numerical score).
- The evaluation is **semantic**—it can recognize correct answers even if they are phrased differently from the reference.

---

### **Typical Prompt to the LLM (under the hood):**

The evaluator might prompt the LLM like this:
> Given the following question, reference answer, and predicted answer, is the predicted answer correct?  
> - **Question:** ...  
> - **Reference Answer:** ...  
> - **Predicted Answer:** ...  
> Respond with "correct" or "incorrect" (or a score).

---

### **Why is this useful?**

- **Automates evaluation:** No need for manual grading.
- **Handles paraphrasing:** Can recognize correct answers even if wording differs.
- **Scalable:** Can evaluate large datasets quickly.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Evaluator Name | Purpose                | How it Works                                  |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `"qa"`         | Answer correctness     | Uses LLM to compare model and reference answer|

---

**In summary:**  
The default LangSmith `"qa"` evaluator is an LLM-powered tool that automatically checks if your model’s answer matches the reference answer for a given question, using semantic understanding rather than just string matching. It’s a key tool for automated, scalable QA evaluation in LLM and RAG pipelines.

Let me know if you want to see the actual prompt or more technical details! 

## Prompt 9
**Prompt:**
ok take a look at the helpfulness evaluator. How does langsmith know what it means to be "helpful" and who is the user?

**Answer:**
Great questions! Let’s break down how the LangSmith "helpfulness" evaluator works and how it understands what it means to be "helpful" and who the "user" is:

---

## **How does LangSmith know what it means to be "helpful"?**

- **Criteria-based Evaluation:**  
  The helpfulness evaluator in LangSmith is configured with a specific criterion—"helpfulness"—which is defined by a prompt or set of instructions you provide.
- **LLM as Judge:**  
  When evaluating, LangSmith uses an LLM (like GPT-4) to act as a grader. The LLM is given a prompt that describes what "helpfulness" means in the context of the task.
- **Customizable Prompt:**  
  In your notebook, the helpfulness evaluator is set up like this:

  ```python
  labeled_helpfulness_evaluator = LangChainStringEvaluator(
      "labeled_criteria",
      config={
          "criteria": {
              "helpfulness": (
                  "Is this submission helpful to the user,"
                  " taking into account the correct reference answer?"
              )
          },
          "llm" : eval_llm
      },
      prepare_data=lambda run, example: {
          "prediction": run.outputs["output"],
          "reference": example.outputs["answer"],
          "input": example.inputs["question"],
      }
  )
  ```

  - The **criteria** string is what tells the LLM what to look for. In this case:  
    *"Is this submission helpful to the user, taking into account the correct reference answer?"*
  - The LLM uses this instruction to judge the model’s answer.

- **LLM’s Understanding:**  
  The LLM uses its general knowledge of language, context, and the provided reference answer to decide if the model’s answer would be helpful to a user asking the question.

---

## **Who is the "user"?**

- **Implied by the Question:**  
  The "user" is the person who asked the original question (i.e., the end-user of your RAG or LLM system).
- **LLM Perspective:**  
  The LLM is prompted to imagine itself as a grader, evaluating whether the answer would be helpful to the person who asked the question, given the reference answer as ground truth.
- **No Explicit Persona:**  
  Unless you specify a particular persona or context in the criteria, the LLM assumes a generic user who wants a clear, accurate, and useful answer to their question.

---

## **How does the process work?**

1. **Inputs:**  
   - The question (from the user)
   - The model’s answer (prediction)
   - The reference answer (ground truth)

2. **Prompt to LLM:**  
   - The LLM is given the above, plus the helpfulness criterion.
   - Example prompt:  
     > Is this submission helpful to the user, taking into account the correct reference answer?  
     > - Question: ...  
     > - Reference Answer: ...  
     > - Model Answer: ...

3. **LLM Decision:**  
   - The LLM uses its understanding of helpfulness (clarity, completeness, relevance, etc.) to judge the answer.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Aspect         | How it’s Determined                                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Helpfulness    | By the LLM, using a prompt that defines "helpful"        |
| User           | The person who asked the question (implied, generic)     |
| Customization  | You can change the criteria prompt to fit your use case  |

---

**In summary:**  
LangSmith knows what it means to be "helpful" based on the instructions you provide in the criteria prompt, and the LLM uses its general knowledge to apply this. The "user" is the person who asked the question, and unless otherwise specified, is treated as a generic end-user.

If you want to see the actual prompt sent to the LLM or customize the helpfulness definition, let me know!

---

## Prompt 10
**Prompt:**
I see so to get a more accurate assessment of how "helpful" the answer is, you would have to specify in the criteria something like "the user is a student looking at deciding on taking a course" and perhaps define "helpful" to mean something a little more specific?

**Answer:**
Exactly right!  
To get a more accurate and contextually relevant assessment of "helpfulness," you should:

---

### **1. Specify the User Persona**
- **Example:**  
  Instead of a generic user, you can tell the LLM:  
  *"The user is a student deciding whether to take a course."*

---

### **2. Define "Helpful" More Precisely**
- **Example:**  
  You might say:  
  *"A helpful answer should clearly address the student's concerns, provide actionable information about the course, and mention any prerequisites or benefits relevant to a prospective student."*

---

### **3. Update the Criteria in the Evaluator**
- **How to do it in code:**
  ```python
  labeled_helpfulness_evaluator = LangChainStringEvaluator(
      "labeled_criteria",
      config={
          "criteria": {
              "helpfulness": (
                  "The user is a student deciding whether to take a course. "
                  "A helpful answer should clearly address the student's concerns, "
                  "provide actionable information about the course, and mention any prerequisites or benefits."
              )
          },
          "llm": eval_llm
      },
      prepare_data=...
  )
  ```

---

### **Why does this help?**
- **Contextual Judgement:**  
  The LLM will now judge answers through the lens of a student’s needs, not just generic helpfulness.
- **Alignment with Real Use Case:**  
  You get feedback that’s more aligned with your actual users and their goals.
- **Reduced Ambiguity:**  
  The LLM is less likely to reward answers that are technically correct but not useful for your specific user.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Without Persona/Specificity         | With Persona/Specificity                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Generic "helpful" (vague)           | Contextual "helpful" (tailored to user and scenario)    |
| LLM uses general knowledge          | LLM uses scenario-specific criteria                     |
| May miss user-specific needs        | Focuses on what matters to your actual users            |

---

**In summary:**  
Yes, by specifying the user persona and what "helpful" means in your context, you guide the LLM to provide much more relevant and actionable evaluations. This is a best practice for any LLM-powered evaluation—be as specific as possible about the scenario and criteria!

Let me know if you want help crafting a custom helpfulness prompt for your use case! 

## Prompt 11
**Prompt:**
See Question #2 in the notebook in the context of the RAG application defined in the notebook. What does "performance" mean in the question?

**Answer:**
In the context of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application defined in your notebook, **"performance"** in Question #2 refers to how well your RAG system is able to answer user questions using the provided documents and retrieval pipeline.

---

### **What does "performance" mean here?**

**Performance** is a broad term, but in this context, it specifically refers to:

- **Accuracy:**  
  How often does the system provide correct answers to user questions, as judged by evaluators (like the LangSmith "qa" evaluator)?
- **Helpfulness:**  
  Are the answers useful, clear, and actionable for the user (as judged by the helpfulness evaluator)?
- **Completeness:**  
  Does the answer fully address the question, or is it partial/incomplete?
- **Relevance:**  
  Is the answer based on the most relevant context retrieved from the documents?
- **Faithfulness:**  
  Does the answer stick to the information in the provided context, or does it hallucinate/make things up?

---

### **How is performance measured in the notebook?**

- **Automated Evaluation:**  
  The notebook uses LangSmith evaluators (like `"qa"`, `"helpfulness"`, and `"empathy"`) to automatically score the answers produced by the RAG chain.
- **Metrics:**  
  These evaluators provide scores or labels (e.g., correct/incorrect, helpful/not helpful) for each answer, which can be aggregated into overall performance metrics (accuracy, average helpfulness, etc.).

---

### **Why does chunk size affect performance?**

- **Chunk size** determines how much context is available to the retriever and, ultimately, to the LLM when answering a question.
- If chunks are too small, important context may be split across multiple chunks and not retrieved together, leading to incomplete or less accurate answers.
- If chunks are too large, irrelevant information may be included, making it harder for the LLM to focus on the right details.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Aspect of Performance | How it's Reflected in the Notebook                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy             | Correctness of answers (QA evaluator)             |
| Helpfulness          | Usefulness/clarity of answers (Helpfulness eval)  |
| Completeness         | Fullness of answer (QA/Helpfulness eval)          |
| Relevance            | Use of relevant context (QA/Helpfulness eval)     |
| Faithfulness         | Sticking to context, not hallucinating            |

---

**In summary:**  
In this RAG application, "performance" means how well the system answers questions—measured by correctness, helpfulness, completeness, and relevance—using automated evaluators on the answers it generates.

## Prompt 12
**Prompt:**
Can you explain how the embedding model size affects the relevance of chunks retrieved in a RAG?

**Answer:**
Absolutely! Here’s how the **embedding model size** affects the **relevance of chunks retrieved** in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system:

---

## **What is the embedding model in RAG?**

- The embedding model converts text (chunks, queries) into high-dimensional vectors.
- These vectors are used to measure similarity between the user’s question and the document chunks, so the most relevant chunks can be retrieved.

---

## **How does model size come into play?**

### **1. Larger Embedding Models = Richer Representations**
- **Larger models** (with more parameters and trained on more data) can capture more nuanced meanings, context, and relationships between words and phrases.
- They can better understand synonyms, paraphrases, and subtle context differences.

### **2. Improved Semantic Similarity**
- With a **small/less capable model**, two texts that are semantically similar but use different wording might not be recognized as close in vector space.
- A **larger model** is more likely to map semantically similar texts to nearby vectors, even if the wording is different.

### **3. Better Handling of Complex Queries**
- Larger models can better handle long, complex, or ambiguous queries, and match them to the right context in your documents.

---

## **How does this affect relevance?**

- **Higher relevance:**  
  The retriever is more likely to surface chunks that truly answer the user’s question, not just those with overlapping keywords.
- **Fewer false positives/negatives:**  
  Less likely to retrieve irrelevant chunks (false positives) or miss relevant ones (false negatives).
- **Improved downstream answers:**  
  The LLM gets better context, so the final answer is more accurate and helpful.

---

## **Example**

Suppose your query is:  
*"What are the eligibility requirements for a Pell Grant?"*

- **Small embedding model:**  
  Might only match chunks that contain the exact phrase "eligibility requirements" and "Pell Grant".
- **Large embedding model:**  
  Can match chunks that talk about "who can apply for Pell Grants", "criteria for receiving federal aid", or "student qualifications", even if the wording is different.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Model Size      | Semantic Understanding | Retrieval Relevance | Example Retrievals         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Small           | Shallow (keywords)    | Lower               | Only exact matches         |
| Large           | Deep (semantics)      | Higher              | Paraphrases, contextually relevant |

---

**In summary:**  
A larger embedding model improves the relevance of retrieved chunks in RAG by providing richer, more semantically accurate representations of both queries and documents. This leads to better matches, more useful context, and ultimately, better answers.

## Prompt 13
**Prompt:**
In the earlier exercise (in the notebook) where we use build a knowledge graph using the input PDF files and then that gets used by RAGAS to first create meta data like summary, headlines for each node. How does RAGAS use this information to create the test queries and reference answers?

**Answer:**
Great question! Here’s how RAGAS uses the knowledge graph and the generated metadata (like summaries and headlines) to create test queries and reference answers:

---

## **1. Building the Knowledge Graph**

- **Nodes:** Each chunk/page from your input PDFs becomes a node in the knowledge graph.
- **Metadata:** For each node, RAGAS (using LLMs and embedding models) generates metadata such as:
  - **Summary:** A concise description of the node’s content.
  - **Headlines/Themes/Entities:** Key topics, entities, or themes present in the chunk.

---

## **2. Why Generate Metadata?**

- **Summaries and headlines** make it easier for RAGAS to understand the content and context of each node.
- This metadata provides a high-level, structured view of the document, which is more efficient for generating meaningful and diverse queries.

---

## **3. How RAGAS Uses Metadata to Create Test Queries**

### **a. Scenario and Persona Generation**
- RAGAS uses the metadata to imagine realistic scenarios and personas (e.g., a student, administrator, etc.) who might interact with the document.

### **b. Query Synthesis**
- For each node (or combination of nodes), RAGAS uses the summary, headlines, and other metadata to:
  - **Identify possible questions** that a user might ask about the content.
  - **Determine the type of query:** single-hop (answerable from one node) or multi-hop (requires combining info from multiple nodes).
  - **Generate the query text** using an LLM, often referencing the summary/headlines to ensure the question is relevant and grounded in the actual content.

### **c. Reference Answer Generation**
- Once a query is generated, RAGAS uses the same metadata (and sometimes the full node content) to:
  - **Extract or synthesize the reference answer**—the “ground truth” answer to the query.
  - This is done by prompting the LLM to answer the question using only the information in the relevant node(s).

---

## **4. Example Flow**

Suppose a node has:
- **Summary:** "Explains eligibility requirements for Pell Grants."
- **Headlines:** ["Pell Grant", "Eligibility", "Federal Aid"]

**RAGAS might generate:**
- **Query:** "What are the eligibility requirements for a Pell Grant?"
- **Reference Answer:** "To be eligible for a Pell Grant, a student must demonstrate financial need, be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, and be enrolled in an eligible degree or certificate program."

---

## **5. Why is this approach effective?**

- **Grounded Queries:** Questions are based on actual content, not random or generic.
- **Diverse Coverage:** By using metadata from all nodes, RAGAS can generate queries that cover the breadth of the document.
- **Automated Reference Answers:** The LLM can synthesize accurate answers using the node’s summary/content, ensuring the test set is high quality.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step                | What Happens                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Metadata Generation | Summaries/headlines created for each node                |
| Scenario/Persona    | LLM imagines realistic user and scenario                 |
| Query Synthesis     | LLM generates question using node metadata               |
| Reference Answer    | LLM answers the question using node summary/content      |

---

**In summary:**  
RAGAS uses the metadata (summaries, headlines, etc.) from each node in the knowledge graph to generate realistic, content-grounded test queries and reference answers. This ensures the synthetic test set is both relevant and challenging for evaluating your RAG pipeline.
