    "# Multi-Agent LangGraph System for Research Paper Social Media Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a multi-agent LangGraph system that takes a research paper description and creates social media posts optimized for different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of 4 main agents:\n",
    "1. **SEARCH_AGENT**: Searches arXiv for research papers and extracts content\n",
    "2. **SOCIAL_MEDIA_AGENT**: Creates social media posts from paper content\n",
    "3. **COPY_EDITOR**: Refines posts to fit the target platform's tone\n",
    "4. **SUPERVISOR**: Coordinates workflow between agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Parameters\n",
    "- Research paper description\n",
    "- Target social network (LinkedIn, X, Facebook)\n",
    "- Objective of the social media post\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "- Social media post saved as markdown text file"

      "QLoRA stands for Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation, a method that allows for the finetuning of LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters using only 2/3/4-bit precision on consumer-grade GPUs. This innovation is a game-changer for researchers and practitioners who face memory constraints while working with large models.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 **Key Benefits:**  \n",
      "1. **Memory Efficiency:** QLoRA enables finetuning with significantly less memory compared to traditional methods, making it accessible for those with limited computational resources.  \n",
      "2. **Performance:** It achieves competitive results in various tasks such as text classification, natural language inference, and instruction following, even outperforming existing methods in some cases.  \n",
      "3. **User-Friendly:** The accompanying library, **llmtune**, simplifies the process of quantizing, running, and finetuning LLMs, allowing practitioners to focus on their research rather than technical hurdles.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌟 **Why It Matters:**  \n",
      "As the demand for more powerful AI models grows, QLoRA provides a pathway for efficient model training and deployment, democratizing access to advanced machine learning capabilities. This is a significant step towards making cutting-edge AI technology available to a broader audience.\n",

This innovation is a game-changer for researchers and practitioners who face memory constraints while working with large models.  \n",
      "\n",
      "💡 **Key Benefits:**  \n",
      "1. **Memory Efficiency:** QLoRA enables finetuning with significantly less memory compared to traditional methods, making it accessible for those with limited computational resources.  \n",
      "2. **Performance:** It achieves competitive results in various tasks such as text classification, natural language inference, and instruction following, even outperforming existing methods in some cases.  \n",
      "3. **User-Friendly:** The accompanying library, **llmtune**, simplifies the process of quantizing, running, and finetuning LLMs, allowing practitioners to focus on their research rather than technical hurdles.  \n",
      "\n",
      "🌟 **Why It Matters:**  \n",
      "As the demand for more powerful AI models grows, QLoRA provides a pathway for efficient model training and deployment, democratizing access to advanced machine learning capabilities. This is a significant step towards making cutting-edge AI technology available to a broader audience.  \n",
